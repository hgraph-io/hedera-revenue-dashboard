## About

Hgraph's Hedera Revenue Dashboard was created to expose a core KPI required to measure the health of the Hedera network. This KPI has been highly requested by developers, leaders and the broader community. "Revenue" in this context is considered to be the fees earned through transactions submitted to the Hedera network.

A core consideration is that Hedera payer account `0.0.1459478` (attributed to Atma) contributes to over 75% of the networks revenue. Because of this, a "filter" has been added to the revenue dashboard to remove these transactions from calculations to get a more granular view of Hedera's revenue data.

This revenue dashboard is a demonstration of Hgraph's data science work and analytics capabilities, as well as a powerful public tool for the Hedera community.

## Features

* Time dropdown: Change the time period for information displayed.
* Percentage: Show the change between the selected time period and the last.
* Date: The current date.
* Filter: Remove transactions by `0.0.1459478` from calculations.

## Run Locally

### Prerequisites:
1. **Visual Studio Code**: Make sure you have VS Code installed. You can download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. **Node.js**: Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) if you haven't already. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Steps to Run the Website:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open a terminal in VS Code by pressing `Ctrl + ` (backtick) or go to `View > Terminal`.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/hgraph-io/hedera-revenue-dashboard.git
     ```
   - Navigate into the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd hedera-revenue-dashboard
     ```

2. **Run the Website Using `npx serve`**:
   - If the project is a static site and you just want to serve the `src` directory, you can use the following command:
     ```bash
     npx serve src
     ```
   - This command uses `npx` to run the `serve` package, which serves the `src` directory as a static website.
   - Once the server is running, open your browser and go to the URL provided (usually [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)) to view the website.

3. **Alternative Method: Using the Live Server Extension**:
   - If you prefer to use the `Live Server` extension for serving static websites, follow these steps:
     1. Install the `Live Server` extension from the VS Code marketplace.
     2. Open the `hedera-revenue-dashboard` project folder in VS Code.
     3. Navigate to the `src` directory in the Explorer pane.
     4. Right-click on the `index.html` file and select `Open with Live Server`.
   - This will launch the website in your default browser, and any changes you make to the code will automatically refresh in the browser.

4. **Editing the Code**:
   - You can now edit the website's code in the `src` directory using VS Code.
   - Both `npx serve` and the `Live Server` extension will automatically reload the website whenever you save changes to the files.

### Optional: Building the Website for Production
- If you need to build the website for production, use the following command:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- This will create an optimized production build in the `build` directory, which you can deploy to your preferred web hosting service.
