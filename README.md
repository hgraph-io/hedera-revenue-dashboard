# Hgraph's Hedera Revenue Dashboard

A lightweight application and public website that allows anyone to view revenue generated by the Hedera network in the form of transaction fees earned on the mainnet. Its features allow for easy analysis of the network's health. The dashboard incorporates the Hedera network through a GraphQL API built on top of Hedera mirror node infrastructure hosted by Hgraph.

## About

Hgraph's Hedera Revenue Dashboard was created to expose a core, new KPI required to measure the health of the Hedera network. This "revenue" KPI in this context is considered to be the fees earned by Hedera through transactions submitted to the Hedera network.

A core consideration is that Hedera payer account `0.0.1459478` (attributed to Atma) contributes to over 98% of transaction volume and over 78% of the network's revenue earned via transaction fees. Because of this, a "filter" has been added to the UI of the revenue dashboard to remove these transactions from calculations to get a more granular view of Hedera's revenue data.

This revenue dashboard is a demonstration of Hgraph's expertise in building on Hedera’s technology, as well as a powerful public tool for the Hedera community. It utilizes the "read" side of the Hedera network through mirror nodes and Hgraph's infrastructure. Mirror nodes are crucial for queries, analytics, audit support and monitoring. Without mirror nodes data stored on the network stored on the network would not be easily accessible.

A most important aspect of this tool is simplicity. Rather than overwhelm users with an influx of complicated information, we present the ecosystem with a simple yet powerful tool so we can all have better visibility into the health and growth of the Hedera network. Many concessions were made to achieve this level of simplicity and clarity in a quick timeframe.

## Features (user guide)

* **Time dropdown:** Update the time period for the displayed information. These time periods are relative to the current date and time. For example, "Last Year" refers to the 365 days leading up to the current date.
* **Percentage:** Display the percentage change between the selected time period and the previous one, relative to today's date. For example, if 'Last Month' is selected, show the percentage difference between the most recent 30 days and the 30 days preceding that.
* **Date:** The current date and time in UTC format, which is important for providing context when users share screenshots of this website on social media.
* **Filter switch:** This feature excludes all Hedera transactions paid by account 0.0.1459478 from the revenue calculations.
* **Income:** Transaction fees collected by Hedera, categorized by key network services: HTS, HCS, HSCS, and "other."
* **Deposits:** The total revenue generated by Hedera through transaction fees is divided into three key areas: nodes, treasury and staking.
* **Caching:** Mirror node queries are cached so front-end data loads immediately for users.

## Methodology

The information displayed on Hgraph's Hedera Revenue Dashboard is explained below.

### Revenue (HBAR)

Hedera's revenue is calculated as follows:
- Transactions are submitted to the Hedera mainnet
- Each transaction has fees associated with it:
  - HBAR sent to consensus nodes ([link](https://hashscan.io/mainnet/nodes))
  - HBAR sent to staking account `0.0.800`
  - HBAR sent to Hedera treasury account `0.0.98`
- Different transaction types, belonging to different network services, have different fee amounts
- Hgraph calculates transaction fees collected by Hedera since genesis
- Hgraph breaks apart revenue earned by each service
  - HTS (Hedera Token Service)
  - HSCS (Hedera Smart Contract Service)
  - HCS (Hedera Consensus Service)
  - Other (all other services, including HFS)

### Revenue (USD)

- The amount of revenue (in HBAR) shown is converted in real-time to USD.
- All USD conversions are done at the current market rate.
- As fees are collected in HBAR on the Hedera network, all calculations are done using HBAR. The displayed USD amount is strictly to provide context regarding network revenue for a given timeframe.

### Date dropdown

- The user can select a variety of timeframes: last hour, day, week, month, quarter, year, and all time.
- When the date range is changed, the revenue KPIs update in real-time for easy comparative analysis.
- Update the time period for the displayed information. These time periods are relative to the current date and time. For example, "Last Year" refers to the 365 days leading up to the current date.

### Percentage indicator

- Under the main revenue numbers, a percentage indicator can be seen.
- This signifies the increase or decrease in revenue over the previous window of time.
  - Example: If a user selects `1 month` from the date dropdown, the percentage indicator will compare the revenue generated from the last month against the revenue generated the month prior.

### Filter for `0.0.1459478`

- Over 78% of Hedera revenue is generated by this account, associated with Atma (a use case by Avery Dennison).
- To get a more nuanced understanding of Hedera network revenue, a filter "switch" has been added to the dashboard.
- This filter removes all transactions paid for by account `0.0.1459478` in our revenue calculations.

## Data retrieval and computation

Want to show this revenue data on your own application or website? We make it possible by publishing the GraphQL API queries we use to query the data directly from our hosted Hedera mirror nodes. Below you will find these queries. You can sign up for an [Hgraph API Key](https://hgraph.com) to retrieve data from our mirror nodes.

### View GraphQL Queries

You can see the queries used on Hgraph's Hedera Revenue Dashboard in the repository located [in the following folder](https://github.com/hgraph-io/hedera-revenue-dashboard/tree/main/public/hgraph/queries): `public/hgraph/queries`

You can also view SQL computations [in the following folder](https://github.com/hgraph-io/hedera-revenue-dashboard/tree/main/sql).

### Example query

This is an Hgraph advanced GraphQL query for all time Hedera revenue generated by transaction fees. Using this query, you can pull the computed data from our mirror node.

```
query AllTimeTransactionFees {
  all: ecosystem_metric_aggregate(
    where: {name: {_eq: "transaction_fees"}, period: {_eq: "hour"}}
  ) {
    aggregate {
      sum {
        total
      }
    }
  }
  atma: ecosystem_metric_aggregate(
    where: {name: {_eq: "atma_transaction_fees"}, period: {_eq: "hour"}}
  ) {
    aggregate {
      sum {
        total
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Run Application Locally

### Prerequisites:
1. **Visual Studio Code**: Make sure you have VS Code installed. You can download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. **Node.js**: Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) if you haven't already. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Steps to Run the Website:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open a terminal in VS Code by pressing `Ctrl + ` (backtick) or go to `View > Terminal`.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/hgraph-io/hedera-revenue-dashboard.git
     ```
   - Navigate into the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd hedera-revenue-dashboard
     ```

2. **Run the Website Using `npx serve`**:
   - If the project is a static site and you just want to serve the `src` directory, you can use the following command:
     ```bash
     npx serve src
     ```
   - This command uses `npx` to run the `serve` package, which serves the `src` directory as a static website.
   - Once the server is running, open your browser and go to the URL provided (usually [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)) to view the website.

3. **Alternative Method: Using the Live Server Extension**:
   - If you prefer to use the `Live Server` extension for serving static websites, follow these steps:
     1. Install the `Live Server` extension from the VS Code marketplace.
     2. Open the `hedera-revenue-dashboard` project folder in VS Code.
     3. Navigate to the `src` directory in the Explorer pane.
     4. Right-click on the `index.html` file and select `Open with Live Server`.
   - This will launch the website in your default browser, and any changes you make to the code will automatically refresh in the browser.

4. **Editing the Code**:
   - You can now edit the website's code in the `src` directory using VS Code.
   - Both `npx serve` and the `Live Server` extension will automatically reload the website whenever you save changes to the files.

### Optional: Building the Website for Production
- If you need to build the website for production, use the following command:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- This will create an optimized production build in the `build` directory, which you can deploy to your preferred web hosting service.
